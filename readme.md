## Frequently Asked Questions

- **What do you mean by European?**

When talking about Europe, there are multiple views of Europe: Europe as continent, European Union (EU), Europe Economic Area (EEA), ...

I mainly write this _Awesome_ list with data privacy idea, thus I think we should consider _European_ as following: **every EU members + EEA members + Switzerland** <a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.

<a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> (French link sorry: https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-protection-des-donnees-dans-le-monde) Switzerland is considered as adequate for EU in term of data privacy.

- **Why not _Awesome Europe_?**

There are so much awesomeness things in Europe. It can't be listed inside single _Awesome_ list.

Think about existing lists like: [_Awesome GDPR_](https://github.com/bakke92/awesome-gdpr)

_Awesome Europe_ may be created afterward as meta list to list other _Awesome_ european related list.

- **Which kind of critera must respect the listed services, solutions and/or resources**?

The hard thing! And I'm not enough expert to dictact all the rules, see open issue (#1) and participate if relevant.

Currently, the rules should be: **own by European entities and users' data must be stored by an European provider in Europe**.

That mean, we can't accept service build & develop in Europe but run on _AWS_, _Azure_ or _Alibaba cloud_ (for example). Even if using _AWS_ on Europe region only, because of [CLOUD Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act).

- **What kind of topics/sections/categories will be dealt with on the list?**

I'm a big fan of [_Awesome_ selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) and [free for dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev). Authors of those lists already did a great job to categorize services. We should use something close to their structure (or simplified if relevant).
